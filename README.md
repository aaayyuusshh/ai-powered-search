## Overview of Concepts Utilized
- The Large Language Model used is `command` which specializes in generating text.
- The `chat` endpoint is used along with `connectors`.
- Connectors enable connection to external data sources to find and provide the model with relevant info, so the model can utilize the info and generate a response with high degree of accurracy and facts; this is namely Retrieval Augmented Generation, "_retrieving_" relevant info and using that to "_generate_" a response.

I learnt various AI concepts and Cohere specific things through Cohere Docs. I also completed the LLM University module in Cohere. This was my first detailed introduction to AI/ML and I truly enjoyed it, I am looking forward to learn more.
